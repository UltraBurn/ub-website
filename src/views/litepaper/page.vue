The Ultraburn Concept:


Welcome. 

Your journey begins with FIRE!
 
Fire is passion. Fire is power. Fire is illumination. 

Fire is warmth. Fire is life.

Fire is destruction.

Fire.

A primal force so great, that it was said Prometheus had to steal it from the sun so mankind could survive!

We revere it, and we fear it. 

We at the ICE community proudly present to you UltraBurn DeFi deflationary token.

Where UltraBurn is the fire, and You are the fire starter. 


What is UltraBurn? 

UltraBurn is a Defi deflationary token, built on the ERC-20 standard, with an extreme burn rate (Called Ultraburning) and built-in staking mechanism. It aims to be the most aggressive deflationary token model in the cryptosphere barring none. 


Ultraburn is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike a regular ERC20 token, Ultraburn has a constantly reducing supply. Holders of Ultraburn own a portion of the total supply of the token rather than an amount of Ultraburn themselves. When the value of 1 Ultraburn token decreases, the supply is decreased. This causes each Ultraburn to be worth more.

The price of UltraBurn is calculated by dividing the number of tokens in the Uniswap pool, with the number of ETH paired with it. As the supply of tokens in the Uniswap poll reduces, the price will rise.

Any user who has staked at least 300 tokens may call the burn function at any time. 

From the time of the last burn, a burn pool percentage rate will start to build, to a maximum percentage of 5% (to prevent large spikes) of the total supply. 

How are the tokens distributed after the burn?

10% of the burn amount to the user who initiates the burn
40% of the burn amount split among users who have staked tokens, relative to the staked amount
50% of the burn amount will be burned forever

With UltraBurn, the user will decide how much they are willing to risk in order to reap the reward. 

Our staking mechanism also benefits from the UltraBurn philosophy, by introducing a novel mechanic to redistribute staking fees. 

On staking;

- 5% of the transaction will be distributed to other users who have staked. 

Upon unstaking;

- 25% of the transaction will be redistributed in the same manner. 

This will encourage staked tokens to remain locked for longer and will leave the user to decide the degree of risk they are willing to take, knowing that they will be forfeiting 25% when unstaking.




How do I know this isn’t a scam/rug pull?

The team is here for the long haul. We are not a team that will hide from the community.

There will be a raised of Ethereum via a presale and the launch price on Uniswap will be determined how many Ether raised. Funds will be allocated for liquidity purposes and market price set at 20% above the presale price. 

The presale for liquidity fundraising will be conducted with strategic partners from the cryptosphere so that users can be assured that their funds are not the victim of the all too prevalent scam. 

Team tokens will be locked and released over time. 

For the first three hours after launch, there will be no fees for staking, so that users are not front-run by bots seeking to get early gains. 

Staking fees will be activated by the smart contract, automatically, once the three hour time period has expired. 

We want to build a strong, and engaging community. We plan on hosting contests, and creating other unique opportunities to reward our community members — with a portion of the tokens we will set aside for these purposes — and more. 
Relevant wallet addresses will be published, and able to freely be viewed from any blockchain explorer.


In conclusion:

How will the free market behave? 

How will traders react to a constantly reducing supply? 

What will the space make of the most aggressive deflationary token in existence? 

What are the limits of our current concept of what a deflationary asset is?

Who knows?

We don’t have an answer, but if UltraBurn excites you, you might want to join us to find out.


Remember. We are Ultraburn.....where....you.....are.....the FIRESTARTER!
